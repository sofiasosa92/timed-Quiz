### Description:
For this week's challenge, i was given instructions to create a Javascript timed quiz that allowed the user to answer trivia questions while a timer was running. The challenge was to allow the user to accumulate points for each correct question and but also lose 10 seconds on the timer if chosen the wrong answer. This project was made using HTML, VS code, css and Javascript.
